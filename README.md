# note-taker-3000

## An app that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. My first foray into using express and writing back-end code. 



#
## User Story
AS A small business owner
#
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a note-taking application

WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column


## How to Use
Let's get started! Click on the Get Started button on the home page to start adding notes. When you get to the notes page, on the left, you see saved notes along with a delete icon to trash the note when you're done. On the right, you can create a new note with a title and notes within the description. On the top right-hand corner, you can click save to automatically save the new note to the list on the left.
